This project is specifically tailored to facilitate the administration and completion of a single online quiz. 
It features two separate spaces: one dedicated to students and the other for administrators/professors, each offering unique functionalities.

The administrator's role primarily involves managing existing quizzes, questions, and answers. They have the capability to modify and organize quizzes as needed. 
However, the creation of new quizzes is not supported, as this project is intended for a single-time quiz.

Conversely, students utilize the platform to actively participate in the quiz, submit their answers, and subsequently view their results or grades upon completing the quiz.
